## About SponsorExplorer

SponsorExplorer is a modern rewrite of Lartza's SBbrowser, with a lot of features that utilizes
both SponsorBlock and YouTube Data APIs.

The goal for this project is for anyone to inspect and/or monitor creator's sponsors, selfpromos,
etc. on their backlog of videosâ€”expanding users' submissions, even in realtime!

My motivation for creating SponsorExplorer in the first place is creating a Tampermonkey script
for SBbrowser to:

- Distinguish segments that are color-coded respectively
- Include YouTube titles and thumbnails from submissions via the YouTube API

...then it dawned in me that a thought crosses my mind, "what if I create a website that tracks
submissions from channels?" And so, SponsorExplorer came to be!
